## Movie Recommendation and Success Prediction System

A web-based machine learning project that recommends movies based on content similarity and predicts movie success. Built with Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit, and deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access.

## Features

ðŸ“Œ Movie recommendation engine based on cosine similarity of movie features.

ðŸ“Œ Success prediction model using machine learning.

ðŸ“Œ Clean, interactive Streamlit web app.

ðŸ“Œ Uses preprocessed .pkl files for fast loading.

ðŸ“Œ Deployed live via Streamlit Cloud.

## Tech Stack

Frontend & Deployment: Streamlit

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Version Control: GitHub
