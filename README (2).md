## Movie Recommendation and Success Prediction System

A web-based machine learning project that recommends movies based on content similarity and predicts movie success. Built with Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit, and deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access.

## Features

📌 Movie recommendation engine based on cosine similarity of movie features.

📌 Success prediction model using machine learning.

📌 Clean, interactive Streamlit web app.

📌 Uses preprocessed .pkl files for fast loading.

📌 Deployed live via Streamlit Cloud.

## Tech Stack

Frontend & Deployment: Streamlit

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Version Control: GitHub
